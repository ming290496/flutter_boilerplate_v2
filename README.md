# Flutter Skeleton Version 2

A mobile app project created in flutter using BLOC architecture and reactive programming. This project support iOS and Android devices.

## Getting Started

The project contains the minimal implementation required to create a project. The repository code is preloaded with some basic components like basic app architecture, app theme, constants and required dependencies to create a new project. By using this code as standard initializer, we can have same patterns in all the projects that will inherit it. This will also help in reducing setup & development time by allowing you to use same code pattern and avoid re-writing from scratch.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
